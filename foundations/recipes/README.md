# Recipes

## Brief

This project is an exercise demonstrating knowledge of basic html and git workflows.

### Deomonstrations:

- html boilerplate
- basic html page structure structure
- git comprehension

### Reflection:

Completing this project has reinforced some simple fundamentals. I think most importantly, has exposed some of the cumbersome aspects of static web page development. The error prone manner in manually manipulating tags, etc, with information that could and likely is held in databases, etc... Attempting to get uniformity across multiple seperate pages could be difficult as well as time consuming.

I tried to be more specific with my git commits, complying with the recommended git workflow. In the past, I often abuse the `git commit -m "non-desriptive message"` method. At the time, I thought no harm in non informative messages. However, after going back to some previous work, it would have helped to have some context to look back on; with properly formatted git commits.
